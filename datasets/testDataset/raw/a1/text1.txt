For much of the last week, scenes like those played out for hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans who use prepaid debit cards instead of banks. A technical problem had blocked account access for holders of one of the most popular prepaid cards, RushCard.

RushCard, founded in 2003 by the hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons, said on Tuesday that the problem had been mostly fixed. But thousands continued to experience difficulties.

The breakdown illustrates the potential perils for those without access to the banking system. For days, many RushCard users have been venting their frustration and outrage on Twitter and Facebook.
