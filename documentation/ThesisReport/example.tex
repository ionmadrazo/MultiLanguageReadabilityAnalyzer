%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Some General Information about LaTeX
%
% LaTeX source (also called "code") files are split into two basic parts:
% the preamble, which contains package loading commands, and other
% document-wide definitions, and the main document text.  The preamble starts
% with the \documentclass command and ends with the \begin{document} command.
% The main text is contained between the \begin{document} and \end{document}
% commands.  
%
% Only LaTeX commands (and whitespace) are allowed in the preamble.  A LaTeX
% command has the form
%
%   \<name>{<arg>}{<arg>}...
%
% where the number of arguments is set by the command definition. 
% Some commands allow an optional argument
%
%   \name[<opt>]{<arg>}{<arg>}...
%
% which may or may not be given.  There are also LaTeX environments
%
%   \begin{<name>}...\end{<name>}
%
% which can be nested, but must be balanced. 
%
% (If you haven't already guessed, anything after a '%' character on a line
% is taken as a comment and ignored.)
%
% In the main text all non-commands and non-comments are treated as ordinary 
% text.  LaTeX normally treats any run of spaces as a single space.  Line 
% breaks are ignored (TeX uses its own linebreaking algorithm); blank lines
% are paragraph separators.  Runs of blank lines are treated as a single
% blank line.  A common mistake novice users make is to try to use literal
% spacing and line breaks in the .tex file to control formatting.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Packages

% The 'graphicx' package is quite extensive; the main purpose here is
% the includion of PostScript graphics.  The 'dvips' option makes it work
% better with 'dvips' (which is what is often used under Linux)
%\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% Comment the above line and uncomment below to use pdflatex
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% Then the figures should be in pdf, jpg or png format.
\usepackage{setspace}
% The hyperref package provides support for hyperlinks inside/outside the document
\usepackage{url}
%\usepackage[colorlinks=true]{hyperref}

% Others to consider

% The 'subfigure' package does a nice job handling and labelling subfigures
%\usepackage{subfig}

% If you want to use PostScript fonts (or the Nimbus knockoffs) try
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage[scaled=0.92]{helvet}

% The 'citesort' package puts mutliple citation numbers in order
%\usepackage{citesort}


% Generate intra-document links and also allows url and href commands for
% to generate embedded links in the document.
% This breaks the build right now :-(
%\usepackage{hyperref}
%\hypersetup{
%	colorlinks=true
%}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Local commands

% Define your macros (new commands) here.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front Matter Definitions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% These definitions are used by the commands below to construct the front 
% matter pages.  

% Document title
% The \titleBreak command produces a line break in the title on the
% title page (this may be necessary to keep longer titles from looking
% strange)
\title{An Ode to Foo:\titleBreak Homage to a Great and Wonderful Person}  

% Author's name (must be exactly what name the Registrar has)
% normally it is of the form "First Middle Last"
\author{Foo Admirer}  

% Day of oral defense
\graduationDay{1st}

% Month of graduation (do not abbreviate)
\graduationMonth{December}

% Year of graduation
\graduationYear{2014} 

% Advisor (chair) 
% Use full name, with surname last, without any titles
% The \advisor command accepts an optional argument that specifies the
% advisor's position, which defaults to "Advisor"; for example,
%
% \advisor[Chair]{Foo the Great} 
%
% causes "Chair" to appear on the approval page (the one with the signatures) 
% in place of "Advisor"
\advisor{Foo The Great, Ph.D.} % also the chair of your committee

% Committee members: \committeeA is listed first after the advisor,
% \committeeB second, etc.  An optional argument is accepted to replace
% the default "Committee Member" position.
\committeeA{Aaa, Ph.D.} 
\committeeB{Bbb, Ph.D.}

% Master's committees normally have three members, but in case there is
% a need for more, use these commands
%\committeeC[Ex-Officio Committee Member]{ccc}
%\committeeD{ddd}

% Full name of the degree; normally "Master of Science"
\degree{Master of Science}

% Full name of major
\major{Computer Science}

% Major department
\department{Computer Science}

% College 
\college{Engineering}

% Current department chair (at the moment, this is not used)
\departmentChair{Tim Andersen}

% Current graduate dean
\graduateDean{John R. Pelton}

% Document abstract
\abstract{ An \emph{abstract} is a brief summary of the document.  A typical
  abstract provides a brief introduction, enough to provide context for the
  document, explains the purpose of the thesis or project, and summarizes the
  major results and conclusions.  Keep in mind that a casual observer is
  likely to judge the content of the document by the abstract and title alone.
  (There is an old addage: ``in a joke, the punchline comes at the end; in a
  paper [or thesis], it comes in the abstract.'')  A single concise paragraph
  usually suffices for the abstract.  If it spills onto a second page, it is
  probably too long.  }


% The remaining elements are optional

% \includeCopyright causes a copyright page to be produced.  It is not
% required; in fact, a copyright notice is no longer needed to ensure
% copyright protection.  
\includeCopyright

% \maxPage is used to format the page numbers in the table of contents.
% The actual value is not important: the width of the value given is used
% as the maximum width of any page number.  The following values are suggested
%
% \maxPage{99} for less than 100 pages (this is the default)
% \maxPage{199} for less than 200 pages
% \maxPage{999} for less than 1000 pages 
%
% (If the work is more than 1000 pages, consider cutting it down!)
% The space has to be wide enough for front matter page numbers, which are
% miniscule Roman numerals.  This might have to be widened if there are
% more than 12 front matter pages (which might happen if there is a long
% list of symbols or list of abbreviations, like this template has).
\maxPage{199}

% The Acknowledgments page is a place for the author to express thanks
% or generally acknowledge anyone or anything that assisted in the 
% project or research.  If the student was supported even in part by 
% funding from research grant, it needs to be acknowledged here.
% The Acknowledgments section can have multiple pages, just like the
% Abstract section, but like the abstract, more than one page is probably
% too long.  Acknowledgments are often written in the third person, but
% it is one place (the only place) in the document where first-person
% references (i.e., the use of "I") can be acceptable.
\acknowledgments{
The author wishes to express gratitude to Foo.  This work would have been
partially supported by some particular grant, if there was one.
}

% The work can be "dedicated" to someone, typically family members or
% someone similar.  Unlike acknowledgments, which are included in almost
% every thesis or prject, many students omit the dedication.
\dedication{dedicated to foo}


% A brief autobiographical sketch can be included.  Many students omit this.
% If it is included, remember that it is a sketch, so keep it brief.  Also
% try to limit the content to academically relevant material, such as under-
% graduate work, previous graduate work, employment, etc.  Some students
% like to include their military service.  Otherwise, unless you have
% overcome some particular adversity, it's probably better to leave out
% personal information.
\biosketch{
Foo Admirer was born admiring Foo. Foo Admirer has been tinkering
with admiration of Foo for a long time. Now it is time to to be blessed by
Foo.
}

% The title of the bibliography defaults to "References" but if you include
% references that are not specifically cited in the text, it needs to be
% titled "Bibliography" instead.

\chapter{Introduction}

% The \label{<tag>} command allows the chapter to be referenced elsewhere
% in the text by the <tag>: 'Chapter~\ref{ch:intro}' gets formatted as
% "Chapter 1" or whatever number this chapter gets assigned.  It usually
% requires a second 'latex' execution to get the labels right.  (The labels
% are stored in the ".aux" file, and that gets updated each time latex runs.)
%   Writers who use LaTeX a lot are often in the habit of adding labels to
% chapter, figure, and table, then adding other labels to things like sections
% and subsections as they are needed.  Label tags follow no specific format,
% but it's typical to include a colon-terminated prefix to indicate what
% is being labeled, e.g.
%
%   ch:<name>  for chapters
%   sec:<name> for sections
%   tbl:<name> for tables
%   fig:<name> for figures
%
% WARNING: Do not use numbers or special characters such as '_', '$', etc.
%          in label tags (although ':' is okay).

\label{ch:intro}

% \section adds a first-level subheading

footnotes\footnote{What's not to like about footnotes, anyway?  Brian
  O'Nolan and George MacDonald Fraser both used them to great effect}.
So here is some extra stuff:%
\footnote{Too many footnotes, however, can be distracting.}
% A '%' comment character at the end of a line, like above, has the
% effect of "escaping" the newline, thereby avoiding adding a space.
% In this case, it prevents there being space between the end of the
% text and the footnote superscript

\subsection{Where are the style files?}

% \cite{<tag>} is bibilography citation; <tag> must match a bibliography
% item label.  It can take multiple, comma-separated, arguments.

% The '~' is a "tie", which is an unbreakable space.  That is, it is
% the same a a space but TeX won't break the line there.  Ties are used
% between text and a reference or citation, to avoid something like Figure
% 1, which looks weird.

Please consult the guide from Graduate College~\cite{guide} for resolving any
style issues that are not addressed by the style files that provided along
with this document. The files associated with this style can be found on the
website~\cite{amit}.

% \texttt{} changes to "typewriter" (monospaced) font, which is typically
% used for literal code or filenames.
% \emph{} "emphasizes" the text, which normally means placing it in
% italics if the running text is in Roman font, or vice-versa.

The file \texttt{bsu-ms.cls} contains the formatting directives for the
\emph{bsu-ms} style.  It is based on the standard \LaTeX\ \texttt{report} style
with 12 point font option.  
% \begin{enumerate} creates a numbered list.
\begin{enumerate}
% \item starts a new list item.
\item Simply copy \texttt{bsu-ms.cls} to the directory containing your \LaTeX\
document.  That way, \LaTeX\ will find it, because it looks in
current directory by default.  

\item The current style file may be installed in some directory available
system wide.  (Ask your systems administrator if this is the case).
You will have to include that directory in the path \LaTeX\ uses to search 
for input files.  Under Linux, this is controled by the \texttt{TEXINPUTS}
environment variable, which can be set in the \texttt{.bashrc} file in your 
home directory.  For example
% The 'verbatim' environment formats text in the typewriter font,
% just as it appears in the file.
%
% WARNING: 'verbatim' doesn't expand tab characters, so if you cut and paste
% be sure to remove any tabs (you can use the 'M-x untabify' command in emacs).
\begin{verbatim}
    TEXINPUTS=.:/usr/local/texinputs/:/usr/share/texmf//
    export TEXINPUTS
\end{verbatim}
  adds \texttt{/usr/local/texinputs}, a possible location for
  \texttt{bsu-ms.cls}, although it will not take effect until you
  \texttt{source} the \texttt{.bashrc} file, or log in again.

\item Install the style files in a directory under your accounts and set the
\texttt{TEXINPUTS} variable accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
% If you have blank lines before the \begin{enumerate} or after the
% \end{enumerate} it makes the LaTeX code easier to read, but it also
% starts a new paragrah.  You can always use empty comments for readablilty.
%
% Although, you can always use \noindent to prevent paragraph indentation.
The first or third way is recommended, becaue they involve making a local copy
of the style file.  This assures your document format will not be affected
affected by subsequent updates to \texttt{bsu-ms.cls} (but gives you the
option to copy the updated file if you want).

% Chapter: The Greatness of Foo
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{The Greatness of Foo}\label{ch:fooGreatness}

\section{Previous work}
The greatness of Foo The Great derives from her early work as documented in
her books~\cite{foo:book1,foo:book2}.

\section{What are their names?}
Please consult the articles by Admirer~\cite{me:paper1} and Admirer,
Smith and Doe~\cite{me:paper2} for more details. Note that the references are
cited by the last names of all authors for three authors or less. For more
than three authors, ``et al'' can be used. 

%! The \label command applies to the most recent heading in the main text,
%! or the current figure or table.  
%! The \pageref{<tag>} command references the page number of a label.
Check the References on page~\pageref{references} for an example of how to
format the references. 

\section{The code of Foo}

%! \textbf{} sets text in bold face.  It is useful in headings, but
%! is rarely used in running text.  It is used here to denote literal
%! LaTeX commands, and to illustrate its use.  Normally it is preferable
%! to use \emph{} to emphasize text.
When showing a program fragment, use the \textbf{verbatim}
environment. However, when you wan to show an algorithm, use either the
\textbf{tabbing} or \textbf{algorithm} enviorment.

Thesis text is normally ``double'' spaced.  It is customary to single-space
literal code.  Figure~\ref{fig:code} shows a sample Java program.

% The 'figure' environment starts a new figure, which is a type of
% "floating" element.  That means it goes where LaTeX decides to put it, 
% rather than at the current point in the running text.  Don't be surprised
% when figures and tables get placed in unexpected places.  
%
% You can control, to some degree, where floating elements go by setting
% the optional argument of \begin{figure}.  The options are
%
%   h - place the figure at this point, if possible (avoid this)
%   t - place the figure at the top of a page
%   b - place the figure at the bottom of a page
%   p - place the figure on a special page containing only figures and tables
%
% The options can be combined, and a '*' can be appended to make LaTeX
% try harder to match the request.  For example, \begin{figure}[tp*]
% allows the figure to be placed at the top of the page or on a special
% page ([tp*] is in fact the default set in "bsu-ms.cls").  Avoid using
% [h] by itself--it is inflexible and can cause formatting problems.  At
% the same time, it can be very useful in forcing figure placement.
% Finessing figure placement is a typesetting task that you just have to get 
% used to, no matter what system you are using.  
% 
% WARNING: when LaTeX has trouble placing floating elements, it sometimes 
%          puts all of them at the very end of the document.  So if your 
%          figures and tables suddenly disappear, check the end of the
%          document.  Adding more 'p' specifiers can help with this.

\begin{figure}
\begin{vcode}  % an alternative to 'singlespace', that also shrinks the
               % typewriter font so that it blends better with the text
\begin{verbatim}
  import java.awt.Font;

  public class Clock extends UpdateApplet {
      public void init() {
          setFont(new Font("TimesRoman",Font.BOLD,24));
          resize(400,100);
      }

      public void paint( java.awt.Graphics g ) {
          g.drawString( new java.util.Date().toString(), 20, 20 );
      }
  }
\end{verbatim}
\end{vcode}
%\caption{} gives the figure or table a caption, which is normally
% placed below the figure (but above a table).  The caption is also
% used as the title of the figure in the list of figures.  An optional
% argument gives the figure a "short title" for use in the list of
% figures, which is useful if the caption is long, or includes some
% extra information.
\caption[An Embedded Java Clock]{An Embedded Java Clock.  This figure
also serves as an example of the inclusion of literal code.}
%
% WARNING: the labels can get screwed up if the label in a figure is given
%          before the caption (another one of LaTeX's quirks)
\label{fig:code} 
\end{figure}


\section{Other mysteries of Foo}

Here is an itemized list of all the mysteries of Foo.
% The 'itemize' environment is for unordered lists: the items are bulleted
% rather than numbered.  A different bullet style is used for itemized
% lists inside itemized lists.
\begin{itemize}
\item Mystery 1.
\item Mystery 2.
\item Mystery 3.
\item Mystery 4.
\end{itemize}

% Tables are like figures, except that they are numbered separately
% and the caption is placed at the top.  Also there is a separate
% list of tables in the front matter.

Here is a simple table.

\begin{table}[h] % 'h' in this case prevents the table from being placed
                 % too close to the figure
% By custom, the caption of a table is placed at the top of the table.
\caption{The Approximate Time of Parallelizing Each Code}
% (The label must follow the caption)
\label{table4}
\centering % tables need be horizontally centered
% The 'tabular' environment can be used to format tables.  Unfortunately
% it is one of the more cumbersome LaTeX constructs.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline \hline
Parallel library/language  &WRS Code  &OCS Code  &ICSAMD Code\\ \hline

% There are different bibliography styles; 'plain' is used for theses.
\bibliographystyle{plain}

% One way of constructing the bibliography is to list the entries explicitly
% in a 'thebibliography' environment, which is done here.
%
% If you prefer, you can use the 'bibtex' program, which formats the 
% bibliography from a separate .bib file of "BibTeX" entries.  An advantage
% is that most references are available online in bibtex format, and
% doing cut-and-paste from the web browser can save you a lot of work.
% But it also adds extra complication.  The normal sequence, after you 
% have changed anyting in the .bib file is
%
%   latex <filename>.tex
%   latex <filename>.tex
%   bibtex <filename>
%   latex <filename>.tex


% Literal Bibliography

% The 99 means make labels be as wide as the width of the number 99
