\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is a readability score?
\item What are the uses of a readability score?

\end{itemize}
\section{Related work}
\subsection{Historical readability measures}
Description of basic readability scores. When and where were they used? Fleisch etc...
\subsection{General State of the art}

\subsection{State of the art for English}
\subsection{State of the art for Spanish}
\subsection{State of the art for Basque}



\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Pipeline decription}
Describe the whole process for prediction. Texts processing, feature extraction, feature processing, prediction.

\subsection{Text processing}
Description of Freeling NLPTools, which modules are we using. Description of each module with a general description and examples. Generate hypotheses of why this module should add valuable information to the text.

\subsection{Feature extraction}
Description of all the features used. Why should this feature be valuable, give hypotheses and intuition behind the use of each feature. Give examples when needed.

\subsection{Feature processing and selection}
Describe algorithms used for feature processing and selection, why should they help get better results?

\subsection{Learning and prediction}
Describe algorithms for learning and prediction. Pros an cons of each algorithm, why should this algorithm adapt better to our problem?

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Datasets}
Information about how we get and extract the datasets.
\subsubsection{English}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lexile
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Spanish}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lexile
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Basque}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ikasbil
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Tests}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Comparison} of the system vs \textbf{baselines} such as fleish for each language individually.

\item Comparison \textbf{vs state of the art} systems for each language.

\item Which features add the most value? Correlation, information gain etc.

\item Do features correlate similarly with the readability score for each language?

\item Feature preprocessing, does it help?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Discretization
	\item Feature subset selection techniques
	\end{itemize}
	
\item Comparison of learning models, which learning model fits best the problem?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item KNN
	\item Bayesian models
	\item SVM
	\item Neural network
	\item Ordinal classification
	\end{itemize}

\item If we take a bilingual corpus, does the system predict same values? And if we take a text and translate it to another language? Does the readability values mantain using an automatic translator?
\end{itemize}
