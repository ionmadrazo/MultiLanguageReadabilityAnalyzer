	it is important to teach students how to use information to create new 
	knowledge and to communicate new ideas far beyond the simple, literal 
	understanding of a passage.

	networking, texting, video downloads, MP3 downloads, and 
	smashups, they are not generally skilled with online information use, 
	including locating and critically evaluating information (Bennett, 
	Maton, & Kervin, 2008).
